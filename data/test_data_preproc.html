                     <p class="oj-normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the interconnectedness of human, animal, and ecosystem health and the risks posed by the loss of biodiversity on Earth. As recognised by the World Health Organization, many of the same microbes infect animals and humans, so efforts that focus only on human health or only on animal health cannot prevent or eliminate the problem of disease transmission. Diseases may be transmitted from humans to animals or vice versa and therefore need to be tackled in both humans and animals, taking advantage of potential synergies in research and treatments. Approximately 70 % of emerging diseases, and almost all known pandemics, namely influenza, HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, are zoonoses. Those diseases have increased globally over the past 60 years. Changes in land use, deforestation, urbanisation, agricultural expansion and intensification, wildlife trafficking and consumption patterns are factors that have contributed to that increase. Zoonotic pathogens can be bacterial, viral or parasitic, and can include unconventional agents that are able to spread to humans through direct contact or through food, water or the environment. The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of the need to reinforce the application of the One Health approach in the Union to achieve better public health outcomes, since, as stated in Regulation (EU) 2021/522 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc4-L_2022020EN.01000101-E0004" href="#ntr4-L_2022020EN.01000101-E0004"

In that regard, it has demonstrated the need to strengthen the Union’s role in order to be more effective in managing the availability of medicinal products and the availability of medical devices and <span class="oj-italic">in vitro</span> diagnostic medical devices and their respective accessories (collectively ‘medical devices’) and in developing medical countermeasures to address the threats posed to public health at an early stage in a harmonised way that ensures cooperation and coordination between Union, national and regional competent authorities, medicinal products and medical devices industry and other actors in the supply chains for medicinal products and medical devices, including healthcare professionals. While the Union needs to give a higher priority to health, its ability to ensure the continued provision of high quality healthcare services and to be prepared to address pandemics and other health threats has been severely impeded by the absence of a clearly defined legal framework for managing its response to pandemics and by the limited mandates and resources of its health agencies, as well as by the limited degree of Union and Member States preparedness for public health emergencies that impact a majority of the Member States.</p>

It has also led Member States competing with each other when they respond to the legitimate needs of their citizens, thereby contributing to uncoordinated actions at national level, such as national hoarding and stockpiling. Those issues further resulted in new entities being involved in the expedited production of such medical devices, which subsequently resulted in delays in conformity assessments and the prevalence of medical devices that were over-priced, non-compliant, unsafe, and, in some cases, counterfeits. It is therefore appropriate and a matter of urgency that long-term structures be established within the European Medicines Agency (the ‘Agency’), established by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc6-L_2022020EN.01000101-E0006" href="#ntr6-L_2022020EN.01000101-E0006"

Furthermore, shortages of medicinal products can result in serious risks to the health of patients in the Union due to their lack of availability, which can result in medication errors, increased duration of hospital stays, adverse reactions and increased risk of fatalities caused by the administration of unsuitable medicinal products used as a substitute for unavailable medicinal products. With respect to medical devices, shortages can lead to a lack of diagnostic resources with negative consequences for public health measures or to a disease deteriorating or not being treated, and may also prevent health professionals from adequately carrying out their tasks or being protected when doing so, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with serious consequences for their health. Such shortages, for example, insufficient supply of COVID-19 test kits, can also have a significant impact on control of the spread of a given pathogen. It is therefore important to have an appropriate framework at Union level to coordinate the Union response to shortages of medicinal products and medical devices and to reinforce and formalise the monitoring of critical medicinal products and medical devices in the most efficient way and in a way that avoids creating unnecessary burdens for stakeholders which can place a strain on resources and cause additional delays.</p>

To facilitate the development of the ESMP, existing IT systems should be leveraged and used where possible. The ESMP should allow national competent authorities to submit and monitor information on unmet demand, including information received from marketing authorisation holders, wholesale distributors and other persons or legal entities that are authorised or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public, in order to anticipate shortages of medicinal products. The ESMP could also process additional information received from marketing authorisation holders, wholesale distributors and other persons or legal entities that are authorised or entitled to supply medicinal products to the public in order to avert a public health emergency or a major event. The ESMP, once it is fully implemented, should act as the sole portal for marketing authorisation holders to provide the information required during public health emergencies and major events, with a view to increasing efficiency and predictability during public health emergencies and major events, and to accelerating the decision-making process while avoiding duplication of efforts and unjustified burdens on stakeholders. In order to facilitate the coordination role of the Agency, the interoperability of data with existing Member States’ IT platforms for monitoring shortages and other systems, as appropriate, is essential to allow the sharing of relevant information with the ESMP, which should be managed by the Agency.</p>

Those information and data are essential for making correct adjustments in the manufacturing of medicinal products to avoid or at least mitigate the impact of shortages of medicinal products.

International regulators pointed out the need to improve the clinical research agenda in order to generate robust evidence on quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products. The main way of obtaining reliable evidence is through coordinated, well-designed, and adequately powered large randomised controlled trials.

                     <p class="oj-normal">Although individual research entities may agree with each other or with another party to act as a sponsor in order to prepare a single harmonised Union-wide clinical trial protocol, experience during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that initiatives to set up large multinational trials struggle to materialise due to the lack of a single entity that is able to take up all the responsibilities and activities of a sponsor within the Union as well as interact with multiple Member States. To address that problem, a new Union-wide and Union-funded vaccine trial network called VACCELERATE was launched following the Commission communication of 17 February 2021 entitled ‘HERA Incubator: Anticipating together the threat of COVID-19 variants’. The Agency should identify and facilitate such initiatives by giving advice on the possibilities for acting as a sponsor or, where applicable, for allocating respective responsibilities as co-sponsors in accordance with Article 72 of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 and coordinate the development of clinical trial protocols. Such an approach would strengthen the research environment in the Union, would promote harmonisation and would avoid subsequent delays in availability of results of research for marketing authorisation files. A Union sponsor could benefit from Union research funding available at the time of the public health emergency as well as from existing clinical trial networks to facilitate the development, application, submission, and running of trials. This may be particularly valuable for trials established by Union or international public health or research organisations.</p>

                     <p class="oj-normal">One of the aims of this Regulation is to ensure a strengthened framework for monitoring of and reporting on shortages of medicinal products during public health emergencies and major events. As announced in the communication of the Commission of 25 November 2020 entitled ‘Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe’, the Commission will propose to revise the pharmaceutical legislation to enhance the security of supply and address shortages of medicinal products through specific measures. That legislation could cover a further coordinating role for the Agency in monitoring and managing shortages of medicinal products. If, as a result of that revision, strengthened measures regarding monitoring of and reporting on supply of and demand for medicinal products at Union level are required, the ESMP should be considered as a suitable system to facilitate any new provisions relating to monitoring of and reporting on shortages of medicinal products. As part of the reporting on this Regulation, the Commission should consider the need to extend the scope of this Regulation to include veterinary medicinal products and personal protective equipment, to amend definitions and to introduce measures at Union or national level to strengthen compliance with the obligations set out in this Regulation. That review should include consideration of the remit and functioning of the ESMP. The extension of the functioning of the ESMP and the need for national shortages monitoring systems should be considered if necessary. In order to prepare for shortages of medicinal products during public health emergencies and major events and to support the monitoring of such shortages, capacity building that is supported by Union funding mechanisms should be considered in order to enhance cooperation among Member States. This could include the exploration of best practices and the coordination of the development of IT tools for monitoring and managing shortages of medicinal products in Member States and for connecting to the ESMP. To ensure that the ESMP is used to its full potential and to identify and forecast problems relating to supply of and demand for medicinal products, where appropriate, the ESMP should facilitate the use of big data techniques and artificial intelligence.</p>

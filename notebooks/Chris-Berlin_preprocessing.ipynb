    "In line with the Rome Declaration of the Leaders of 27 Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission of 25 March 2017, the Union budget should enable a safe and secure Europe. Nuclear decommissioning programmes have already contributed in this respect and can further contribute. After the shutdown of a nuclear facility, the main positive impact to be achieved is the progressive reduction of radiological risk for the workers, the public and the environment in the Member States concerned as well as in the Union as a whole.\n",
    "\n",

    "A dedicated financial programme can bring additional EU added value by becoming a benchmark within the Union for the safe management of technological issues in nuclear decommissioning and the dissemination of knowledge. Financial assistance under such a financial programme should be provided on the basis of an ex ante evaluation identifying the specific needs and demonstrating the EU added value, with the aim of supporting the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and the safe management of radioactive waste.\n",

Financial assistance under this Regulation should remain exceptional, without prejudice to the principles and objectives stemming from Union law on nuclear safety, namely Council Directive 2009/71/Euratom (2), and waste management, namely Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom (3). Pursuant to Articles 4(1) and 7(1) of Directive 2011/70/Euratom, the ultimate responsibility for the safe management of the spent fuel and radioactive waste generated remains with the Member States.\n",

In application of that Article, site agreements were signed during the period 1960-1962 between the Community, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. In the cases of Italy and the Netherlands, national nuclear installations were transferred to the Community. An infrastructure geared to nuclear research and comprising new installations was put in place at the four sites. Some of those installations are still in use today, while others have been shut down, in some instances more than 20 years ago, and have mostly become obsolete.\n",

Accordingly, the Nuclear Decommissioning and Waste Management Programme at the JRC was launched in 1999 with a communication to the European Parliament and the Council, and since then the Commission has provided regular updates on the progress of that programme.\n",

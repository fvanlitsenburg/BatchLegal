    "\n",
    "In line with the Rome Declaration of the Leaders of 27 Member States and of the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission of 25 March 2017, the Union budget should enable a safe and secure Europe. Nuclear decommissioning programmes have already contributed in this respect and can further contribute. After the shutdown of a nuclear facility, the main positive impact to be achieved is the progressive reduction of radiological risk for the workers, the public and the environment in the Member States concerned as well as in the Union as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dedicated financial programme can bring additional EU added value by becoming a benchmark within the Union for the safe management of technological issues in nuclear decommissioning and the dissemination of knowledge.

    "The Joint Research Centre (‘JRC’) of the European Commission was established by Article 8 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (‘Euratom Treaty’). In application of that Article, site agreements were signed during the period 1960-1962 between the Community, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. In the cases of Italy and the Netherlands, national nuclear installations were transferred to the Community. An infrastructure geared to nuclear research and comprising new installations was put in place at the four sites. Some of those installations are still in use today, while others have been shut down, in some instances more than 20 years ago, and have mostly become obsolete.\n",

regulation euratom no the council of the european unionhaving regard to the treaty establishing the european atomic energy community and in particular article  thereofhaving regard to the proposal from the european commissionhaving regard to the opinion of the european parliament whereasin line with the rome declaration of the leaders of  member states and of the european council the european parliament and the european commission of  march  the union budget should enable a safe and secure europe nuclear decommissioning programmes have already contributed in this respect and can further contribute after the shutdown of a nuclear facility the main positive impact to be achieved is the progressive reduction of radiological risk for the workers the public and the environment in the member states concerned as well as in the union as a wholea dedicated financial programme can bring additional eu added value by becoming a benchmark within the union for the safe management of technological issues in nuclear decommissioning and the dissemination of knowledge financial assistance under such a financial programme should be provided on the basis of an ex ante evaluation identifying the specific needs and demonstrating the eu added value with the aim of supporting the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and the safe management of radioactive wastethe activities covered by this regulation should comply with applicable union and national law financial assistance under this regulation should remain exceptional without prejudice to the principles and objectives stemming from union law on nuclear safety namely council directive euratom  and waste management namely council directive euratom  pursuant to articles  and  of directive euratom the ultimate responsibility for the safe management of the spent fuel and radioactive waste generated remains with the member statesin accordance with the protocol concerning the conditions and arrangements for admission of the republic of bulgaria and romania to the european union  annexed to the treaty concerning the accession of the republic of bulgaria and romania to the european union  ‘treaty of accession’ bulgaria committed to the closure of units  and  and units  and  of the kozloduy nuclear power plant by  december  and  december  respectively and to the subsequent decommissioning of those units the decommissioning has resulted in a significant financial burden of direct and indirect cost for bulgaria in line with its obligations bulgaria shut down all units concerned within the respective deadlinesin accordance with protocol no  on unit  and unit  of the bohunice v nuclear power plant in slovakia attached to the act concerning the conditions of accession of the czech republic the republic of estonia the republic of cyprus the republic of latvia the republic of lithuania the republic of hungary the republic of malta the republic of poland the republic of slovenia and the slovak republic and the adjustments to the treaties on which the european union is founded  ‘act of accession’ slovakia committed itself to the closure of unit  and unit  of the bohunice v nuclear power plant by  december  and  december  respectively and to the subsequent decommissioning of those units the decommissioning has resulted in a significant financial burden of direct and indirect cost for slovakia in line with its obligations slovakia shut down all units concerned within the respective deadlinesin line with their obligations under respectively the treaty of accession and the act of accession and with union assistance bulgaria and slovakia have made significant progress towards the decommissioning of the kozloduy and bohunice v nuclear power plants further work is necessary in order to safely achieve the decommissioning end state based on the current decommissioning plans the decommissioning work is scheduled to be completed by the end of  for kozloduy nuclear power plant and by  for the bohunice v nuclear power plantthe joint research centre ‘jrc’ of the european commission was established by article  of the treaty establishing the european atomic energy community ‘euratom treaty’ in application of that article site agreements were signed during the period  between the community germany belgium italy and the netherlands in the cases of italy and the netherlands national nuclear installations were transferred to the community an infrastructure geared to nuclear research and comprising new installations was put in place at the four sites some of those installations are still in use today while others have been shut down in some instances more than  years ago and have mostly become obsoleteon the basis of article  of the euratom treaty and pursuant to article  of directive euratom the jrc as a licence holder is to manage its historical nuclear liabilities and decommission its nuclear installations that have been shut down in accordance with the relevant national legislation accordingly the nuclear decommissioning and waste management programme at the jrc was launched in  with a communication to the european parliament and the council and since then the commission has provided regular updates on the progress of that programmethe commission has concluded that the best option to satisfy requirements stemming from point f of article  and article  of directive euratom is to pursue a strategy combining decommissioning and waste management activities while initiating the discussions between the jrc and host member states regarding a potential transfer of the decommissioning and spent fuel and radioactive waste management liabilities in the case of mutual agreements between the commission and the host member states the jrc should provide for and maintain adequate resources to fulfil its obligations with respect to decommissioning and the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste managementthis regulation responds to the needs identified for the multiannual financial framework for the period from  january  to  december  and lays down a financial envelope for the entire duration of the nuclear decommissioning assistance programmes of units  to  of the kozloduy nuclear power plant in bulgaria ‘kozloduy programme’ and units  and  of the bohunice v nuclear power plant in slovakia ‘bohunice programme’ and for the decommissioning and spent fuel and radioactive waste management of the commission’s nuclear installations at the jrc sites namely jrcgeel in belgium jrckarlsruhe in germany jrcispra in italy and jrcpetten in the netherlands ‘jrc decommissioning and waste management programme’ that financial envelope is to constitute the prime reference amount within the meaning of point  of the interinstitutional agreement of  december  between the european parliament the council and the commission on budgetary discipline on cooperation in budgetary matters and on sound financial management  for the european parliament and the council during the annual budgetary procedureregulation eu euratom  of the european parliament and of the council  the ‘financial regulation’ applies to the dedicated financial programme for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and the management of radioactive waste the ‘programme’ the financial regulation lays down rules on the implementation of

recovery of funds lost wrongly paid or incorrectly used and where appropriate to the imposition of administrative penalties in particular in accordance with regulations euratom ec no  and eu euratom no  the european antifraud office olaf has the power to carry out administrative investigations including onthespot checks and inspections with a view to establishing whether there has been fraud corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the unionthe european public prosecutor’s office eppo is empowered in accordance with regulation eu  to investigate and prosecute criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the union as provided for in directive eu  of the european parliament and of the council  in accordance with the financial regulation any person or entity receiving union funds is to fully cooperate in the protection of the financial interests of the union grant the necessary rights and access to the commission olaf the court of auditors and in respect of those member states participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to regulation eu  the eppo and ensure that any third parties involved in the implementation of union funds grant equivalent rightsthis regulation does not prejudge the outcome of any future state aid procedures that may be undertaken in accordance with articles  and  of the treaty on the functioning of the european union tfeuthe amount of the appropriations allocated to the programme as well as the programming period and the distribution of funds among the activities may be reviewed based on the results of the interim and final evaluation reports it should be possible for additional budgetary flexibility to be obtained by redistributing funds among activities where and when needed while giving priority to the activities contributing to addressing safety challenges in respect of the decommissioning and radioactive waste management of units  to  of the kozloduy nuclear power plant in bulgaria and of units  and  of the bohunice v nuclear power plant in slovakia without prejudice to other activities carried out under this regulation and in accordance with the financial regulationthe programme should also involve the creation of knowledge and the sharing of experience knowledge and experience gained and lessons learnt under the programme with regard to the nuclear decommissioning process should be disseminated in the union in coordination and synergy with the union programme for decommissioning activities in lithuania as such measures bring the greatest eu added value and contribute to the safety of the workers and the general public as well as protection of the environment the scope procedure and economic aspects of cooperation should be detailed in the multiannual work programme and could also be subject to agreements between the member states andor with the commissionthe jrc should facilitate the dissemination of knowledge among different union stakeholders in a coordinated way for example by carrying out market analysis reviews and assessments of knowledge needs in the union identifying potential directions for cooperation interested stakeholders and spheres in which knowledge created in the implementation of the programme would bring the greatest added value and developing formats for knowledge sharing the dissemination of knowledge created should be financed by the jrc any member state should be able to initiate the development of ties and exchanges for knowledge disseminationthe decommissioning of the nuclear facilities and radioactive waste management covered by this regulation should be carried out with recourse to the best available technical expertise and with due regard to the nature and technological specifications of the installations to be decommissioned in order to ensure safety and the highest possible efficiency thus taking into account international best practiceseffective monitoring and control of the evolution of the decommissioning process should be ensured by bulgaria slovakia and the commission in order to assure the highest eu added value of the funding allocated under this regulation although the ultimate responsibility for the decommissioning rests with the two member states concerned this includes effective measurement of progress and performance and the enacting of corrective measures where necessary to that end a committee with monitoring and information functions should be established and cochaired by a representative of the commission and of the member state concerned similarly a group of independent experts from the member states appointed by the commission assists the jrc decommissioning and waste management programmepursuant to paragraphs  and  of the interinstitutional agreement of  april  on better lawmaking  the programme should be evaluated on the basis of information collected in accordance with specific monitoring requirements while avoiding an administrative burden in particular on member states and overregulation those requirements where appropriate should include measurable indicators as a basis for evaluating the effects of the programme on the groundthe activities under the kozloduy programme and bohunice programme should be identified within the boundaries defined by the decommissioning plans submitted by bulgaria and slovakia in accordance with council regulation euratom no   those plans define the scope of those programmes as well as the decommissioning end states target dates and enddates they also cover the decommissioning activities their associated schedule costs and required human resourcesactivities under the kozloduy programme and bohunice programme should be conducted with a joint financial effort of the union and bulgaria and slovakia respectively in line with the cofinancing practice established under the predecessor programmesregulation euratom no  should therefore be repealeddue account has been taken of the special report no  of the court of auditors entitled ‘eu nuclear decommissioning assistance programmes in lithuania bulgaria and slovakia some progress made since  but critical challenges ahead’in
